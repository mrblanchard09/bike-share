# bike-share
This was a Udacity Data Analyst class project where I developed a Python script to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Project Details

The project data was provided by https://www.motivateco.com/ for three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.  The raw datasets can be accessed on the following site, however Udacity performed some data wrangling and the resulting  clean data files where what I used and have been uploaded into this repository:

a) https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data
b) https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
c) https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

The bikeshare.py file is a Python script that I developed to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:

1) Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?

2) Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?

3) (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?

4) (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe of the data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
